This Julia package uses R functions. To use it, you need a working [Rcall](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl). You also need to install the forecast package in R. Functions of this package are used for outlier removal.  

Once this is done, you can install the Julia package. 
```
pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaPlanet/NighttimeLights.jl
